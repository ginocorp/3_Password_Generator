1. I first started working on the password generator by seeing if I wanted to make any changes to the HTML or CSS before starting the Javascript. Only change I made was the background color and the color of the font. 
2. I then worked on the javascript and began by making my functions for all the password options. 
3. I utilized Charcode, which linked well with studio code already and was a portal to access all the possible characters I needed. 
4. After setting up the functions I started working on the generatepassword() function.
5. I first set the parameters for the password length so the client can only stay between 8-128 characters total and I set up some window.alert returns in case they did not follow the length parameters. 
6. I followed by then making some window.prompt questions so the client can either confirm or cancel a certain passowrd parameter (lower case letter, upper case letter, numbers, and special characters).
7. I had to add "if", "for", and "else" loops to describe when the client would either click confirm or cancel on the prompt.window questions so then they are returned a proper password based on their answers. 
8. Lastly, I made sure the 'addEventListener" was working properly and it would follow by giving out the window.prompt questions again after the generate password button was clicked. 

P.S. there is different code that is commented out at the bottom that I have left there because I wanted to find better way to do the window.prompt section. When I figure it out I will resubmit this homework again. However this is my finished product thus far.
